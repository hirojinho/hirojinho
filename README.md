Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Hiro, a Product Engineer and Backend Developer, passionate about exploring **programming paradigms** and creating scalable applications. I‚Äôm currently focused on developing a **distributed real-time collaborative note-taking application** where multiple paradigms like **event-driven**, **concurrent**, **functional**, **logic**, and **reactive programming** come together.

---

### üöÄ Current Project: Real-Time Collaborative Note-Taking Application
This project allows multiple users to collaborate on notes in real-time, incorporating features like version control, user roles, live chat, and a recommendation system. I'm employing a variety of paradigms and languages to handle different components of the system:

- **Real-Time Collaboration & Chat**: JavaScript, Go, and Erlang to handle event-driven, concurrent, and actor-model architectures for real-time updates.
- **Version Control for Notes**: Haskell (functional) and Prolog (logic programming) to manage immutable document versions and conflict resolution during merges.
- **User System**: Java, implementing object-oriented principles to manage users, roles, and permissions.
- **Recommendation System**: SQL for declarative data extraction, and Scala with reactive programming for dynamic, real-time suggestions based on editing patterns.
- **Data Storage & Analytics**: SQL for declarative queries, with C for performance optimizations and efficient data retrieval.


#### Progress:
- [x] **Real-Time Collaboration**: Implemented with React (Frontend), Erlang (Backend using Actor Model), and Go (Concurrency) 
- [x] **Deployment**: Deployed using Docker, RabbitMQ for message handling
- [ ] **Version Control**: In progress (Haskell for Functional Programming, Prolog for Logic Programming)
- [ ] **User System**: To be developed (OOP with Java)
- [ ] **Recommendation System**: To be developed (Reactive Programming with Scala, Akka Streams)
- [ ] **Data Storage & Analytics**: Planned (SQL for Declarative, C for Imperative Programming)

My work involves optimizing workflows and creating seamless user experiences through automation.

---

### üí° Areas of Interest
- **Programming Paradigms**: I explore the strengths of different paradigms, such as functional, object-oriented, and logic programming.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: With a focus on chatbot automation and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).
- **Backend Development**: Cloud architectures, high-performance APIs, and microservices.
- **Film Analysis & Philosophy**: Analyzing movies through philosophical lenses, combining linguistic and cinematic perspectives.
- **Pure Mathematics**: Topics like abstract algebra, analysis, and discrete mathematics.

### üé∏ Fun Fact
When I'm not coding, I‚Äôm usually listening to **progressive metal** or **math rock**, jamming to bands like *The Fall of Troy* and *Just Vinyl*. I‚Äôm also diving into **film essays**, exploring how movies reflect broader philosophical themes.
